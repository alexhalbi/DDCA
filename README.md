## Run the testbenches

### level1

To run all level1 testbenches, run:

  do level1.do

### level3

To run level3 testbenches

  do core.do [hello|helloworld|md5|decexc|intrs]

Note: hello is a replacement for helloworld, because helloworld contains a
loop that would take very long to simulate. I don't know why atm.
